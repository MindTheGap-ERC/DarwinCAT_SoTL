# Improving student understanding of the fossil record

A Scholarship of Teaching and Learning approach

## Purpose

This repository documents a study to be carried out at Utrecht University in the *Paleontology - fauna* course (GEO2 - 1215) for BSc in Geosciences programme, taking place in 2024. The study will investigate how the interactive application [DarwinCAT](stratigraphicpaleobiology.shinyapps.io/DarwinCAT) improves student understanding of the fossil record. 
The repository contains the instructions for the students (which are a modified version of the Open Educational Resource written for teaching with DarwinCAT).

### Repository structure

-   Instructions for students
    -   `Task_1.qmd`
    -   `Task_2.qmd`

## How to use?

Text and presentation files are provided as [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) files. This is an open source publishing format based on markdown. Quarto files can be edited using text editors and IDEs such as R Studio and rendered to any format: `docx`, `pdf`, `html`. You can preview the contents of the OER directly on GitHub in files with `.md` extension. 

If you would like to edit the OER and export it e.g. to Word or PDF, you can do it in two ways: 

First, clone the repository.

    1. **With R Studio**
    
    Open the file in R Studio, set the following line to your preferred format, e.g.:
    
    ```         
    format: pdf
    ```
    
    And click `Render`.
   
    2. **With Quarto CLI interface**
    
    Change the line as above using any text editor and use Quarto CLI to render it:
    
    ```         
    quarto render
    ```
